All the various create functions can be put in multiple classes
(createHouse, createObstacle, createTree, create Stump, createSapling, createFairy, createDudeNotFull, createDudeFull)

(1) I choose the WorldModel class to put these functions.

(2) I wanted to group it with the parsing functions, which I guess could also be in the ImageStore function.
Creating the entities in the WorldModel class rather than the Entity class just made more intuitive sense to me.
Since the enities are created in the WorldModel, it's just one less extra step.
